# Reviewer

People often want to know what other people think about a book and what impressed them. However, it is hard to know unless you look for a review of the book. Renosh team thought it would be nice to have a platform where people who read books on e-books write their impressive sentences and share their thoughts.

This project will use [epub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js) which is the open source project for EPUB file.
